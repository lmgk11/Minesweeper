# Minesweeper
Simple minesweeper game with PyGame for an introduction to programming during reception week at KTH.

Currently it is a fully playable minesweeper although the code-base is very messy. This is not intended to show good programming practices but instead show what is possible after the first course in programming at KTH.

Left to implement is an AI that plays for you. This will be a strict algorithm evaluating the position on different metrics.
